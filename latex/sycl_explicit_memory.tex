\subsection{SYCL functions for explicit memory operations}
\label{subsec:explicitmemory}

In addition to \glspl{kernel}, \gls{command-group} objects can also be used to
perform manual operations on host and device memory by using the 
\keyword{copy} API of the \gls{handler}.
Manual copy operations can be seen as specialized kernels executing on the 
device, except that typically this operations will be implemented using the
OpenCL host API (e.g, enqueue copy operations).

The SYCL memory objects involved in a copy operation are specified using
accessors.
Explicit copy operations have a source and a destination. 
When an accessor is the \textit{source} of the operation, the destination can be 
a host pointer or another accessor. 
The \textit{source} accessor can have either  \textbf{read} or \textbf{read\_write} access 
mode. 

When an accessor is the \textit{destination} of the explicit copy operation,
the source can be a host pointer or another accessor.
The \textit{destination} accessor can have either 
\textbf{write}, \textbf{read\_write}, \textbf{discard\_write}, 
\textbf{discard\_read\_write} access modes.

When accessors are both the origin and the destination,
the operation is executed on objects controlled by the SYCL runtime.
The SYCL runtime is allowed to not perfom an explicit in-copy operation
if a different path to update the data is available according to
the SYCL Application Memory Model.

The most recent copy of the memory object may reside on any context controlled
by the SYCL runtime, or on the host in a pointer controlled by the
SYCL runtime.  The SYCL runtime will ensure that data is copied to the destination
once the \gls{command-group} has completed execution.

Whenever a host pointer is used as either the host or the destination of these
explicit memory operations, it is the responsibility
of the user for that pointer to have at least as much memory allocated as
the accessor is giving access to, e.g: if an accessor accesses a range
of 10 elements of \codeinline{int} type, the host pointer must at least have 
\codeinline{10 * sizeof(int)} bytes of memory allocated.

A special case is the \codeinline{update_host} method. 
This method only requires an accessor, and instructs the runtime to update
the internal copy of the data in the host, if any. This is particularly
useful when users use manual synchronization with host pointers, e.g.\ 
via mutex objects on the \codeinline{buffer} constructors.

Table~\ref{table.members.handler.copy} describes the interface for the 
explicit copy operations.

The listing below illustrates how to use explicit copy 
operations in SYCL. The example copies half of the contents of 
a \codeinline{vector_class} into the device, leaving the rest of the 
contents of the buffer on the device unchanged.
